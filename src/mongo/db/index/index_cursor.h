     * An IndexCursor is the interface through which one traverses the entries of a given

     *
     * The cursor must be initiailized by seek()ing to a given entry in the index.  The index is
     * traversed by calling next() or skip()-ping ahead.
     *
     * The set of predicates a given index can understand is known a priori.  These predicates may
     * be simple (a key location for a Btree index) or rich ($within for a geo index).
     *
     * Locking is the responsibility of the caller.  The IndexCursor keeps state.  If the caller
     * wishes to yield or unlock, it must call savePosition() first.  When it decides to unyield it
     * must call restorePosition().  The cursor may be EOF after a restorePosition().
