.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fI\%mongod\fP is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB
system. It handles data requests, manages data format, and performs
background management operations.
.sp
This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
for \fI\%mongod\fP. These options are primarily useful for testing
purposes. In common operation, use the \fBconfiguration file
options\fP to control the behavior of
your database, which is fully capable of all operations described
below.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B mongod
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-help, \-h
Returns a basic help and usage text.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B \-\-verbose, \-v
Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on standard
output or in the log file specified by \fI\%--logpath\fP. Use the
\fB\-v\fP form to control the level of verbosity by including the
option multiple times, (e.g. \fB\-vvvvv\fP.)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
Runs the \fI\%mongod\fP instance in a quiet mode that attempts to limit
the amount of output. This option suppresses:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
output from \fIdatabase commands\fP,
including \fBdrop\fP, \fBdropIndexes\fP,
\fBdiagLogging\fP, \fBvalidate\fP, and
\fBclean\fP.
.IP \(bu 2
replication activity.
.IP \(bu 2
connection accepted events.
.IP \(bu 2
connection closed events.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-port <port>
Specifies a TCP port for the \fI\%mongod\fP to listen for client
connections. By default \fI\%mongod\fP listens for connections on
port 27017.
.sp
UNIX\-like systems require root privileges to use ports with numbers
lower than 1024.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bind_ip <ip address>
The IP address that the \fI\%mongod\fP process will bind to and
listen for connections. By default \fI\%mongod\fP listens for
connections on the localhost (i.e. \fB127.0.0.1\fP address.) You may
attach \fI\%mongod\fP to any interface; however, if you attach
\fI\%mongod\fP to a publicly accessible interface ensure that
you have implemented proper authentication and/or firewall
restrictions to protect the integrity of your database.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-maxConns <number>
Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections that
\fI\%mongod\fP will accept. This setting will have no effect if
it is higher than your operating system\(aqs configured maximum
connection tracking threshold.
.IP Note
You cannot set \fBmaxConns\fP to a value higher
than \fI20000\fP.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-objcheck
Forces the \fI\%mongod\fP to validate all requests from clients
upon receipt to ensure that clients never insert invalid documents
into the database. For objects with a high degree of sub\-document
nesting, \fI\%--objcheck\fP can have a small impact on
performance. You can set \fI\%--noobjcheck\fP to disable object
checking at run\-time.
.sp
Changed in version 2.4: MongoDB enables \fI\%--objcheck\fP by default, to prevent any
client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
database.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-noobjcheck
New in version 2.4.
.sp
Disables the default document validation that MongoDB performs on all
incoming BSON documents.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logpath <path>
Specify a path for the log file that will hold all diagnostic
logging information.
.sp
Unless specified, \fI\%mongod\fP will output all log information
to the standard output. Additionally, unless you also specify
\fI\%--logappend\fP, the logfile will be overwritten when the
process restarts.
.IP Note
The behavior of the logging system may change in the near
future in response to the \fI\%SERVER-4499\fP case.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logappend
When specified, this option ensures that \fI\%mongod\fP appends
new entries to the end of the logfile rather than overwriting the
content of the log when the process restarts.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
New in version 2.1.0.
.sp
Sends all logging output to the host\(aqs \fIsyslog\fP system rather
than to standard output or a log file as with \fI\%--logpath\fP.
.IP Warning
You cannot use \fI\%--syslog\fP with \fI\%--logpath\fP.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pidfilepath <path>
Specify a file location to hold the "\fIPID\fP" or process ID of
the \fI\%mongod\fP process. Useful for tracking the
\fI\%mongod\fP process in combination with the \fI\%mongod --fork\fP
option.
.sp
Without a specified \fI\%--pidfilepath\fP option,
\fBmongos\fP creates no PID file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-keyFile <file>
Specify the path to a key file to store authentication
information. This option is only useful for the connection between
replica set members.

and "\fB/administration/replica\-sets\fP."
.RE
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-nounixsocket
Disables listening on the UNIX socket. Unless set to false,
\fI\%mongod\fP and \fBmongos\fP provide a UNIX\-socket.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-unixSocketPrefix <path>
Specifies a path for the UNIX socket. Unless this option has a
value, \fI\%mongod\fP and \fBmongos\fP, create a socket
with the \fB/tmp\fP as a prefix.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fork
Enables a \fIdaemon\fP mode for \fI\%mongod\fP that runs the
process to the background. This is the normal mode of operation, in
production and production\-like environments, but may \fInot\fP be
desirable for testing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-auth
Enables database authentication for users connecting from remote
hosts. configure users via the \fBmongo shell shell\fP. If no users exist, the localhost interface
will continue to have access to the database until the you create
the first user.
.sp
See the \fBSecurity and Authentication\fP
page for more information regarding this functionality.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-cpu
Forces \fI\%mongod\fP to report the percentage of CPU time in
write lock. \fI\%mongod\fP generates output every four
seconds. MongoDB writes this data to standard output or the logfile
if using the \fBlogpath\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dbpath <path>
Specify a directory for the \fI\%mongod\fP instance to store its
data. Typical locations include: \fB/srv/mongodb\fP,
\fB/var/lib/mongodb\fP or \fB/opt/mongodb\fP
.sp
Unless specified, \fI\%mongod\fP will look for data files in the
default \fB/data/db\fP directory. (Windows systems use the
\fB\edata\edb\fP directory.) If you installed using a package
management system. Check the \fB/etc/mongodb.conf\fP file provided by
your packages to see the configuration of the \fBdbpath\fP.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-diaglog <value>
Creates a very verbose, \fIdiagnostic log\fP for troubleshooting
and recording various errors. MongoDB writes these log files in the
\fBdbpath\fP directory in a series of files that begin with
the string \fBdiaglog\fP and end with the initiation time of the
logging as a hex string.
.sp
The specified value configures the level of verbosity. Possible
values, and their impact are as follows.

You can use the \fBmongosniff\fP tool to replay this output
for investigation. Given a typical diaglog file, located at
\fB/data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c\fP, you might use a command in the
following form to read these files:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mongosniff \-\-source DIAGLOG /data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fI\%--diaglog\fP is for internal use and not intended for most
users.
.IP Warning
Setting the diagnostic level to \fB0\fP will cause \fI\%mongod\fP
to stop writing data to the \fIdiagnostic log\fP file. However,
the \fI\%mongod\fP instance will continue to keep the file open,
even if it is no longer writing data to the file.  If you want to
rename, move, or delete the diagnostic log you must cleanly shut
down the \fI\%mongod\fP instance before doing so.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-directoryperdb
Alters the storage pattern of the data directory to store each
database\(aqs files in a distinct folder. This option will create
directories within the \fI\%--dbpath\fP named for each directory.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with your file system and device
configuration so that MongoDB will store data on a number of
distinct disk devices to increase write throughput or disk
capacity.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journal
Enables operation journaling to ensure write durability and data
consistency. \fI\%mongod\fP enables journaling by default on
64\-bit builds of versions after 2.0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journalOptions <arguments>
Provides functionality for testing. Not for general use, and may
affect database integrity.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journalCommitInterval <value>
Specifies the maximum amount of time for \fI\%mongod\fP to allow
between journal operations. The default value is 100 milliseconds,
while possible values range from 2 to 300 milliseconds. Lower
values increase the durability of the journal, at the expense of
disk performance.
.sp
To force \fI\%mongod\fP to commit to the journal more frequently,
you can specify \fBj:true\fP. When a write operation with \fBj:true\fP
pending, \fI\%mongod\fP will reduce
\fBjournalCommitInterval\fP to a third of the set value.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ipv6
Specify this option to enable IPv6 support. This will allow clients
to connect to \fI\%mongod\fP using IPv6
networks. \fI\%mongod\fP disables IPv6 support by default in
\fI\%mongod\fP and all utilities.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-nssize <value>
Specifies the default size for namespace files (i.e \fB.ns\fP). This
option has no impact on the size of existing namespace files. The
maximum size is 2047 megabytes.
.sp
The default value is 16 megabytes; this provides for approximately
24,000 namespaces. Each collection, as well as each index, counts as
a namespace.
.UNINDENT

command on all databases.
.IP Warning
In general, if you have an intact copy of your data, such as
would exist on a very recent backup or an intact member of a
\fIreplica set\fP, \fBdo not\fP use \fBrepairDatabase\fP

.RE
.IP Note
When using \fIjournaling\fP, there is almost never
any need to run \fBrepairDatabase\fP. In the event of an
unclean shutdown, the server will be able restore the data files
to a pristine state automatically.
.RE
.sp
Changed in version 2.1.2.
.sp
If you run the repair option \fIand\fP have data in a journal file,
\fI\%mongod\fP will refuse to start. In these cases you should
start \fI\%mongod\fP without the \fI\%--repair\fP option to
allow \fI\%mongod\fP to recover data from the journal. This will
complete more quickly and will result in a more consistent and
complete data set.
.sp
To continue the repair operation despite the journal files, shut down
\fI\%mongod\fP cleanly and restart with the \fI\%--repair\fP
option.
.IP Note
\fI\%--repair\fP copies data from the source data files into
new data files in the \fBrepairpath\fP, and then replaces
the original data files with the repaired data files. \fIIf\fP
\fBrepairpath\fP is on the same device as
\fBdbpath\fP, you \fImay\fP interrupt a \fI\%mongod\fP
running \fI\%--repair\fP without affecting the integrity of

Defines the value of "slow," for the \fI\%--profile\fP
option. The database logs all slow queries to the log, even when
the profiler is not turned on. When the database profiler is on,
\fI\%mongod\fP the profiler writes to the \fBsystem.profile\fP

database profiler.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-smallfiles
Enables a mode where MongoDB uses a smaller default file
size.  Specifically, \fI\%--smallfiles\fP reduces the initial
size for data files and limits them to 512
megabytes. \fI\%--smallfiles\fP also reduces the size of each
\fIjournal\fP files from 1 gigabyte to 128 megabytes.
.sp
Use \fI\%--smallfiles\fP if you have a large number of databases
that each holds a small quantity of data. \fI\%--smallfiles\fP can
lead your \fI\%mongod\fP to create a large number of files,
which may affect performance for larger databases.

.B \-\-shutdown
Used in \fIcontrol scripts\fP, the
\fI\%--shutdown\fP will cleanly and safely terminate the
\fI\%mongod\fP process. When invoking \fI\%mongod\fP with this
option you must set the \fI\%--dbpath\fP option either directly
or by way of the \fBconfiguration file\fP and the \fI\%--config\fP
option.
.sp
\fI\%--shutdown\fP is only available on Linux systems.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-syncdelay <value>
\fI\%mongod\fP writes data very quickly to the journal, and
lazily to the data files. \fI\%--syncdelay\fP controls how much
time can pass before MongoDB flushes data to the \fIdatabase files\fP
via an \fIfsync\fP operation. The default setting is 60 seconds.
In almost every situation you should not set this value and use the
default setting.
.sp
The \fBserverStatus\fP command reports the background flush
thread\(aqs status via the \fBbackgroundFlushing\fP
field.
.sp
\fBsyncdelay\fP has no effect on the \fBjournal\fP
files or \fBjournaling\fP.

\fIconfig database\fP of a sharded cluster. When running with
this option, clients will not be able to write data to any database
other than \fBconfig\fP and \fBadmin\fP. The default port for
\fI\%mongod\fP with this option is \fB27019\fP and
\fI\%mongod\fP writes all data files to the \fB/configdb\fP
sub\-directory of the \fI\%--dbpath\fP directory.

.B \-\-shardsvr
Configures this \fI\%mongod\fP instance as a shard in a
partitioned cluster. The default port for these instances is
\fB27018\fP.  The only effect of \fI\%--shardsvr\fP is to change
the port number.

.B \-\-noMoveParanoia
Disables a "paranoid mode" for data writes for chunk migration
operation. See the

.sp
By default \fI\%mongod\fP will save copies of migrated chunks on
the "from" server during migrations as "paranoid mode." Setting
this option disables this paranoia.

Changed in version 2.4: \fI\%--sslPEMKeyPassword\fP is only needed when the private

\fI\%--sslPEMKeyPassword\fP whenever using
\fI\%--sslOnNormalPorts\fP, even when the private key was not

Disables the requirement for SSL certificate validation, that
\fI\%--sslCAFile\fP enables. With
\fI\%--sslWeakCertificateValidation\fP, \fI\%mongod\fP will accept
connections if the client does not present a certificate when
establishing the connection.
.sp
If the client presents a certificate and \fI\%mongod\fP has
\fI\%--sslWeakCertificateValidation\fP enabled, \fI\%mongod\fP
will validate the certificate using the root certificate chain
specified by \fI\%--sslCAFile\fP, and reject clients with invalid
certificates.

Use \fI\%--sslWeakCertificateValidation\fP if you have a mixed
deployment that includes clients that do not or cannot present
certificates to \fI\%mongod\fP.
